            <h3>Empowering Humans in Need.
                <br>
                <br>
                Through compassion and relentless determination, my website is intended to do just that. To be a vital resource of immediate support for the less fortunate among us. At the click of a button, those stepping beyond hardship could get the exact resources they need <em>and</em> know where to find them. To be able to illuminate the path from homelessness to hopefulness is not just a goal, but the very heartbeat of my websiteâ€”a testament to my commitment in uplifting the lives of the less fortunate and fostering a brighter, more equitable world.</h3>
