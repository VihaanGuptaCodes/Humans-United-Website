<p>This section of the website would include the Indeed API and it would be able to list all the jobs within a 5 mile radius that can be applied for. However, many of these job listing websites lack jobs for people with less education. To combat this, the website would have its own mini “job social media.” People could post that they can do painting jobs, mow the lawn, etc. Employers who want that kind of job done could then go into the painting or lawn mowing category and find that listing, then contact the individual to get the job done.</p>
